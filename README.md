# 🏠 AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is the initial phase of the AirBnB clone project. The goal is to build a command-line interpreter that manages backend objects like users, places, cities, and more.

The console will support basic operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and displaying objects. It will serve as the foundation for future development including web interface, database integration, and RESTful APIs.

Stay tuned — more features and documentation coming soon!
